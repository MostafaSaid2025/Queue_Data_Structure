# Queue_Data_Structure

This repository showcases a custom implementation of a queue data structure in C. Queues follow a first-in, first-out (FIFO) principle, useful for various tasks like scheduling and breadth-first search. The implementation offers functions for enqueueing, dequeueing, peeking, and status checking, all well-commented and optimized for clarity and efficiency. Developers are welcome to explore, contribute, and provide feedback for continuous improvement.
